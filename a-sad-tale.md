House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

Unfortunately, Ned was found guilty of unspeakable crimes and was beheaded

New character added, Joffrey is the new character and he is very rich and
famous. He wants to be the King so he kills the ruler and then he becomes the
King. The END!!
